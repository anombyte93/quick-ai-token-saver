# ðŸ’° Clipboard Image Token Saver

**Stop wasting money on huge image tokens when using AI!**

This tool automatically calculates how much you could save by optimizing images before pasting them into ChatGPT, Claude, or AI APIs.

## What it does

- Watches your clipboard for screenshots and images
- Calculates how many tokens the image costs in PNG vs optimized WEBP format
- Shows you potential savings in tokens and dollars
- Keeps a running total of how much you could save

## Why you need this

AI image tokens are **expensive**! A single large screenshot can cost:

- **Original PNG**: 25,000 tokens ($0.075)
- **Optimized WEBP**: 8,000 tokens ($0.024)
- **You save**: 17,000 tokens ($0.051) per image

If you use AI daily with images, this adds up to **hundreds of dollars** in savings.

## How to use

1. **Install requirements:**

   ```bash
   pip install Pillow pywin32
   ```

2. **Run the script:**

   ```bash
   python quick_saver.py
   ```

3. **Take screenshots or copy images** - the tool automatically shows potential savings

4. **Reset your stats anytime** by typing `reset` and pressing Enter

## Example output

```
ðŸ“Š CURRENT TOTAL SAVED: 248,472 tokens ($0.7454)
